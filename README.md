# A/B Testing signup process

Testing the signup process using two options.

## Technology

### Ruby
For quick bootstrapping.

### Sinatra
A light-weight framework to match the size of the project.
Rails, and Padrino to a lesser extent, would have been an overkill.

### MongoDb
Simple and scalable persistence.

### Docker
Packaging using Docker for easier deployment. Using Docker Compose in
development to start the stack locally.
